This is a project to install Oracle 19c on a virtual machine using Oracle VirtualBox and the Vagrant platform.

1. Install Oracle VirtualBox

2. Install Vagrant

3. Download Oracle version 19.3 and rename it to "LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip"

4. If you install a bash shell like GitBash or use Windows PowerShell or the Mac Terminal, navigate to the directory where you created the project. In this case, let's assume it's /OracleProjects/Vagrant

5. Copy the Vagrantfile that I've provided in the repository

6. Once there, run the command `vagrant up`

7. After installation, you'll see the installation process and how to connect.

8. To stop the installation, use `vagrant halt`
